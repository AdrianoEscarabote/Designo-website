## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [vue-spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-spinner) - Pre-load
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - to document the components
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) - to build single page applications with Vue

### Continued development

I am very pleased with the outcome of my second Vue project! I have learned a lot and I believe it was a valuable experience to complete this project. Some of the skills I acquired include:

- Developing a single-page application with Vue using Vue-Router.
- Documenting components with Storybook.

As for Storybook, I plan to further improve my knowledge and dedicate more time to fully leverage this tool. In summary, I am thrilled to have completed this project and to have gained more knowledge about Vue.
